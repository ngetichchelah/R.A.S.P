    "### 3-Class vs Binary Classification for Accident Severity Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | 3-Class Approach | Binary Approach |\n",
    "|--------|------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Problem Formulation** | Predicts 3 classes: Slight, Serious, Fatal | Predicts 2 classes: Severe (Fatal+Serious) vs Slight |\n",
    "| **Business Alignment** | Complex output doesn't directly map to dispatch decisions | Clear \"urgent response needed\" vs \"standard response\" |\n",
    "| **Class Imbalance** | Extreme: 86% vs 11% vs 3% | Challenging but manageable: 14% vs 86% |\n",
    "| **Implementation Complexity** | High: Multiple encoding steps, complex pipelines | Moderate: Cleaner implementation, systematic approach |\n",
    "| **Target Variable Handling** | Confusing mapping (1,2,3 â†’ 0,1,2) | Clear binary mapping (Severe=0, Slight=1) |\n",
    "| **Serious Accident Recall** | 3% | 80.3% |\n",
    "| **Fatal Accident Recall** | 7% | Included in Severe class (80.3%) |\n",
    "| **Precision for Severe** | 5% (Serious), 40% (Fatal) | 17.6% (Acceptable for use case) |\n",
    "| **Model Interpretability** | Complex, hard to explain three-way trade-offs | Simple: \"We detect 80% of severe accidents with 17% false alarms\" |\n",
    "| **Computational Efficiency** | Lower: Multiple models, complex tuning | Higher: Focused approach, faster training |\n",
    "| **Actionability** | Poor: Confusing output for dispatchers | Excellent: Clear yes/no for urgent response |\n",
    "| **Code Maintainability** | Complex: Scattered feature engineering, multiple approaches | Cleaner: Systematic preprocessing, focused implementation |\n",
    "| **Threshold Optimization** | Difficult with 3 classes | Straightforward: Balance recall vs precision |\n",
    "| **Operational Practicality** | Low: Complex decision framework | High: Simple binary decision |\n",
